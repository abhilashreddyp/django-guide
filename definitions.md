*Django* is a popular web development framework written in Python. 

*Virtualenv*, or Virtual Environments, is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them.
Basically, if your project has different software versions (and it will) virtualenv allows us to get a self containing project.

*PIP*, or Python Package Installer, allows you to install all types of python-related software including Django, Virtual environments (virtualenv), Python Requests, and more.
